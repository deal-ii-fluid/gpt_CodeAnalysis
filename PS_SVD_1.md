## Summary

The file "PS_SVD_1" contains a Fortran subroutine that implements the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm with some modifications. It takes input matrices and performs SVD on them, normalizes the resulting matrix VTRA, and calculates TPS based on the normalized VTRA, SEVBAK, and DIAGV matrices.

## Parameters

- LARGE(1) (integer*4): An array that determines the size of the matrices.
- T (real*8): A matrix of size (NM, NKN) that contains input values.
- TPS (real*8): A matrix of size (NKN, NM) that is used to store the result of the calculation.
- SEVBAK (real*8): A matrix of size (NM, NKN) used as an intermediate storage.
- VTRA (real*8): A matrix of size (NKN, NKN) used to store the normalized V matrix.
- DIAGV (real*8): A vector of size NKN used to store the singular values obtained from SVD.
- RV1 (real*8): A vector of size NM used as an intermediate storage.
- CEREP(*) (real*8): An array used to store the diagonal values.
- NM (integer*4): The number of rows in the matrices T, SEVBAK, and TPS.
- NKN (integer*4): The number of columns in the matrices T and SEVBAK, and the number of rows and columns in the matrices VTRA and DIAGV.

## Specific Functionality

1. Initialize the SEVBAK matrix by copying the values from matrix T.
2. Initialize the DIAGV and RV1 vectors.
3. Perform the singular value decomposition using the SVDCMP subroutine and obtain the singular values in DIAGV, the normalized V matrix in VTRA, and an error code.
4. Find the maximum value among the singular values.
5. Calculate the minimum singular value threshold by multiplying the maximum value by 1.0E-6.
6. Normalize the VTRA matrix by dividing the non-zero singular value elements.
7. Calculate the TPS matrix by multiplying the normalized V matrix VTRA with the SEVBAK matrix.
8. Return the calculated TPS matrix.

## External Dependencies

The subroutine depends on the following modules and subroutines defined in external files:

- `systune.inc`: An include file containing system-specific tuning parameters.

## Algorithm Implementation

1. Initialize the SEVBAK matrix by copying the T matrix elements.
2. Initialize the DIAGV and RV1 vectors.
3. Perform the singular value decomposition using the SVDCMP subroutine.
4. Find the maximum singular value in DIAGV.
5. Calculate the minimum singular value threshold as a fraction of the maximum singular value.
6. Normalize the VTRA matrix by dividing the non-zero singular value elements.
7. Calculate the TPS matrix by multiplying the normalized V matrix VTRA with the SEVBAK matrix.

## Points of Interest

1. The code does not handle any error cases and assumes successful execution of the SVDCMP subroutine.
2. The specific implementation details of the SVDCMP subroutine are not provided, so it is assumed to be defined in an external file.
3. The input parameters and their specific purposes are not clear from the code alone, and further understanding may require referring to other parts of the code or documentation.
4. The code makes use of external dependencies, such as the "systune.inc" file, which could affect portability and compatibility with different systems.
