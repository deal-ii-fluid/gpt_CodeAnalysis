# Code Review: `bandwidth_mesh`

## Summary

The code `bandwidth_mesh` calculates the bandwidth of a finite element mesh. The bandwidth is a measure of the "geometric" bandwidth of the mesh, which is determined by the adjacency relationships between the mesh nodes.

## Parameters

- `element_order` (integer): the order of the elements.
- `element_num` (integer): the number of elements.
- `element_node` (integer array of size `[element_order, element_num]`): contains the global indices of the local nodes in each element.
- `ml` (integer): output parameter, stores the lower bandwidth of the matrix.
- `mu` (integer): output parameter, stores the upper bandwidth of the matrix.
- `m` (integer): output parameter, stores the bandwidth of the matrix.

## Algorithm Implementation

The algorithm calculates the bandwidth of the finite element mesh by iterating over each element in the mesh. For each element, it iterates over the local nodes and calculates the global indices. It then updates the lower and upper bandwidths (`ml` and `mu`) based on the difference between the global indices.

The computation of the lower bandwidth `ml` is done by finding the maximum difference between two global indices, where the second index is smaller than the first index. Similarly, the computation of the upper bandwidth `mu` is done by finding the maximum difference between two global indices, where the second index is greater than the first index.

Finally, the bandwidth `m` is calculated by adding 1 to the sum of `ml` and `mu`.

## UML Diagram

The UML activity diagram for the `bandwidth_mesh` routine is as follows:

```plantuml
@startuml

start

:initialize variables;
:iterate over each element in the mesh;
:iterate over local nodes in the element;
:get global indices of local nodes;
:update lower bandwidth (ml);
:update upper bandwidth (mu);
repeat while there are more elements
end

:update bandwidth (m);

stop

## Code Quality

Overall, the code is well-written and follows standard coding conventions. Here are some specific observations:

- The code uses meaningful variable names and includes clear comments to describe the purpose of each parameter and variable.
- The code structure is straightforward, making it easily understandable.
- The algorithm correctly calculates the maximum distance between two global indices to determine the bandwidth.
- The code properly handles the symmetry of the node adjacency relationship by ensuring that `ML` and `MU` are equal.

However, there are a few suggestions to improve the code:

- The code would benefit from better indentation to improve readability.
- Although the code is functionally correct, it could be more efficient by optimizing the calculation of `ML` and `MU`. Currently, the code calculates the maximum for each pair of local nodes, which might result in redundant calculations.
- It would be beneficial to have additional error checking and validation for the input parameters to ensure the code handles invalid inputs gracefully.

Overall, the code is well-structured and effectively calculates the bandwidth of a finite element mesh. With some minor improvements, the code can be further optimized and improved.
