# Code Review: timestamp

## Summary

The "timestamp" Fortran 77 code is a small program that prints the current date and time in a specific format. It uses the built-in `date_and_time` subroutine to obtain the current date and time from the system, and then parses and formats the data to display it in a readable form.

## Parameters

- `ampm` (CHARACTER*(8)): Stores the suffix for AM/PM or specific times like "Noon" or "Midnight".
- `d` (INTEGER): Stores the day of the month.
- `date` (CHARACTER*(8)): Stores the original date string obtained from the system.
- `h` (INTEGER): Stores the hour.
- `m` (INTEGER): Stores the minute.
- `mm` (INTEGER): Stores the milliseconds.
- `month` (CHARACTER*(9) ARRAY): Stores the names of the months.
- `n` (INTEGER): Stores the second.
- `s` (INTEGER): Stores the minute.
- `time` (CHARACTER*(10)): Stores the original time string obtained from the system.
- `y` (INTEGER): Stores the year.

## Algorithm Implementation

1. The code starts by declaring the required variables and an array `month` that contains the names of the months.

2. The `date_and_time` subroutine is called to obtain the current date and time string from the system. The date and time are stored in the `date` and `time` variables, respectively.

3. The date string is then parsed using the `READ` statement with the format `(i4, i2, i2)` and assigned to the variables `y`, `m`, and `d`.

4. The time string is similarly parsed using the `READ` statement with the format `(i2, i2, i2, 1x, i3)` and assigned to the variables `h`, `n`, `s`, and `mm`.

5. The code checks the value of the hour (`h`) to determine whether it is AM or PM. If the hour is less than 12, it sets `ampm` as "AM". If the hour is exactly 12, it checks the values of minutes (`n`) and seconds (`s`) to determine if it's "Noon" or "PM". If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and applies similar logic to determine if it's "Midnight" or "AM".

6. Finally, the formatted date and time are printed using the `WRITE` statement and the variables `d`, `month(m)`, `y`, `h`, `n`, `s`, `mm`, and `ampm`.

## Code Quality

The code appears to be well-written and follows Fortran 77 style conventions. However, a few improvements could be made:

1. The code lacks comments and documentation. Adding inline comments or block comments would greatly improve readability and clarity.

2. Magic numbers are used throughout the code, such as 12 for checking AM/PM and midnight/noon conditions. These numbers should be defined as named constants to enhance readability and maintainability.

3. The code uses fixed format I/O for reading and writing data. It would be better to use formatted I/O to make the code more flexible and easier to understand.

Overall, the code accomplishes its purpose effectively, but could benefit from some minor improvements for increased clarity and maintainability.
