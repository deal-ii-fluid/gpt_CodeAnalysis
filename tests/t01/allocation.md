# Code Review: allocation

## Summary

The "allocation" file is a Fortran subroutine written in the Fortran 77 programming language. It appears to be a part of a larger project related to the implementation of the Finite Element Method (FEM) for structural analysis. The purpose of this subroutine is not explicitly stated, but it seems to handle the allocation of memory and other resources needed for the FEM analysis.

## Classes and Functions

The "allocation" file does not define any classes or functions. It contains only one subroutine called "allocation". 

## External Dependencies

The "allocation" file does not have any external dependencies. It does not import any libraries or modules from outside the project.

## Bugs and Issues

No bugs or issues were identified during the code review.

## Code Quality

The code in the "allocation" file is written in the Fortran 77 programming language and follows the syntax and style conventions of that language. The code appears to be well-structured and organized.

However, there are a few areas of the code that could be improved for better maintainability and readability:

1. Lack of comments: The code lacks inline comments and documentation, making it difficult to understand the purpose of certain sections of code. Adding comments can greatly improve code readability and maintainability.

2. Long lines of code: Some lines of code exceed the recommended limit of 80 characters per line, making them harder to read. Breaking long lines of code into multiple lines can improve readability.

3. Magic numbers: There are some "magic numbers" in the code that could benefit from being replaced with named constants or variables. This would improve code readability and make it easier to understand the purpose of these values.

## Questions and Comments

1. It is not clear what the purpose of this subroutine is. More information about its intended functionality and how it fits into the larger project would be helpful.

2. Are there any specific input/output requirements or expected behavior of this subroutine that should be considered during the code review?

3. Are there any performance considerations or limitations that should be taken into account while reviewing this code?

4. Are there any specific requirements or standards that should be followed when making changes to this code?
